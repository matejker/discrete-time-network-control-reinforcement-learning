    "# Network control theory\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that a network is fully controlable if its' states can be changed from any inital condition to arbitary end state. Network control problem can be represented as a state-space linear system of ordinary differentional equations (ODE).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x(t) = Ax(t) + Bx(t)$$\n",
    "with a solution \n",
    "\n",
    "$$x(t) = e^{At}x_0 + \\int_0^t e^{A(t - \\tau)}Bu_\\tau d\\tau$$\n",
    "where $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ are node's states at time t, $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$ is the network adjacency matrix, $B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m}$ is so called _input matrix_ and fianlly $u(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ are actuations or signals at time t. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to _Controllability of complex networks_ [1],  is a result of minimal matching, where we are controling only unmatched nodes, which in the line network case, is the first node."
